## 📝 Overview

PEAT-LLM4LCR (Prompt Engineering and Agent Technology with Large Language Models for Legal Contract Review) is an innovative intelligent Chinese legal contract review method that integrates prompt engineering with agent technology to achieve efficient and accurate contract risk identification and modification suggestion generation. This method transforms the legal contract review process into a chain of thought that guides large language models through prompt engineering, and implements multi-task collaboration through Agent technology.

## 🌟 Key Contributions

🔍 **Proposed PEAT-LLM4LCR Multi-Agent Collaborative Architecture**: This architecture integrates prompt engineering with multi-agent collaboration technology, constructing a distributed cognitive system specifically designed for unstructured text processing. Through an information-sharing pool-based multi-agent collaboration mechanism, combined with the Agent-GoTFlow operational structure, it effectively addresses the challenges of semantic understanding and knowledge representation in unstructured contract texts, while ensuring the interpretability and transparency of the review process.

🤖 **Developed Chain-of-Thought-Based Prompt Template Reasoning Method**: Addressing the challenges of intelligent legal reasoning and risk identification, this paper designs a multi-dimensional reasoning method based on Chain of Thought (CoT). By formalizing the legal reasoning process and transforming abstract legal knowledge into computer-processable reasoning paths, it achieves end-to-end automation from text understanding to risk identification.

🧠 **Innovated LR-STRB Self-Supervised Learning Method**: To address the common problem of scarce training data in professional domains, this paper proposes a general self-supervised learning method—LR-STRB (Logic Rules Self-Taught Reasoner Bootstrap). Through logic rule guidance and iterative self-improvement mechanisms, this method enables models to learn complex reasoning capabilities from limited annotated data, significantly reducing the data dependency for professional domain model training.

📋 **Developed Practical Contract Review Tool System**: Based on the above theories and methods, this paper develops a complete contract review tool system that implements core functions including automatic contract risk identification, modification suggestion generation, and review report output. The system adopts a modular design, supports multiple contract types and review scenarios, and demonstrates excellent scalability and practicality. Experimental results show that the system significantly improves contract review efficiency and accuracy, providing enterprises with an intelligent and efficient contract management solution.

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

Compared to existing methods, PEAT-LLM4LCR achieves significant performance improvements:

- **Review Efficiency**: 34% improvement, substantially reducing manual review time
- **Suggestion Accuracy**: 50% improvement, providing more reliable basis for contract modifications
- **Identification Accuracy**: 92%, precisely identifying potential risks in contracts
- **Precision**: 93%, ensuring the professionalism and reliability of review results
